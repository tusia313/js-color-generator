## 🖌 What's it about?

Creating the websites or aplicattions, I always need a proper set of colors. As inspiration, I can use super simple Color Generator :D
It's my biggest JavaScript project that I've made so far. I'm so proud of it! ❤️  

## 🖌 First look 
An home page welcome us with fresh colors set,
